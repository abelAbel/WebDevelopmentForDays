                'name'(has to be unique) is required, because whenever you want to send the data from this input element to through to the server,
                the server needs some way of identifying what info came from this element, it will do that by looking at the name.
                'maxlength': to restrict the amount of things can be inputed in the field
                'value'(value="name'): default value that appear in the field; really no point in using this attribute
                'size'(size="100"): the size of the text box horizontaly-->
        <br/>
        password:<input type="password" name="password" maxlength="10" size="10"/><!--
        'type'->"password": so that it appears as bullet points-->
