<!--Form -> An area we can add form element on webpage that allows us to gain data from users; e.g password and name section-->
    <form action="" method="get"><!--When leave 'action' blank, means going to submit the data back to the same page-->
    <!--'action' & 'method' are required--><!--'action': basically asking where you want to send the data from this form, where to. e.g can put a url of other file (script);
    'method': How do you want to send the data from this form to the 'action' page. Only 2 method: 'post' and 'get';
    'post': Sends data in the background, somewhere that the user can't see it. *Alot mor secure*, able to send alot more data to the action page
    'get': Not the most secure method. Sends the data right at the end of current url.-->
    </form>
