        <!--The former president regularly teaches Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in his hometown of Plains, Georgia. Just two weeks ago, Carter, 91, appeared under more happy circumstances &#45;&#45; he announced to the church that radiation treatment had successfully eliminated his cancer.-->
        <!--The church's pastor, Jeremy Shoulta, confirmed Sunday's announcement to CNN, saying that the death of Carter's grandson was "very unexpected" and "shocking news."-->
        <!--"Jeremy Carter had not been feeling well [on Saturday], and at some point later in the day he had gone to sleep, and during the course of that time, his heart stopped," he said.

        <!--The decision about what to put into your paragraphs begins with the germination of a seed of ideas; this “germination process” is better known as brainstorming. There are many techniques for brainstorming; whichever one you choose, this stage of paragraph development cannot be skipped. Building paragraphs can be like building a skyscraper: there must be a well-planned foundation that supports what you are building. Any cracks, inconsistencies, or other corruptions of the foundation can cause your whole paper to crumble.-->
        <!--So, let’s suppose that you have done some brainstorming to develop your thesis. What else should you keep in mind as you begin to create paragraphs? Every paragraph in a paper should be:-->
