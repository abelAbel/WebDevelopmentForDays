JQuery is javascript
/*JQuery ready executes when HTML-Document is loaded and DOM is ready (earliest possible)
* The ready event will get triggered when the DOM is ready*/
/*Load executes when complete page is fully loaded, including all frames, objects and images
* The DOM has been loaded and everything on the webpage has been loaded*/
